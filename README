Raising Wesley is an HTML5 block-puzzle game on a polar coordinate grid.
It's been tested in Chromium, Firefox, and IE9. It seems to even work in
windows Safari, but Safari does not support Audio elements before 6, so
it's soundless.

To play it online, go to http://compositiongames.com/wesley/.
To play it locally, download the source, unzip it (in Win 7, that means you
have to copy the folder out of the zip folder), and open index.html in
your browser.
